TODO:
    High Priority
        - Some particles vanish and aren't advected
        - Some particles don't bounce off the continent despite avoidcoastlines = .true.
        - Only africa setup works instinctively
        - Other runs only work if copying LGM to LGM2 and relinking data_raw in expt_LGM2/nests
                -- Why??? This makes no sense

    Middle Priority
        - Nice graphics
        - Check Gregor's AO Control to get a baseline for various currents
        - Check mort module to include radiodecay of eg C14 or Usomething to Pbsomethingelse
        - Volumetric Flow Rate versus Euler

    Low Priority
        - get everything into one qsub script, including python graphic scripts
        - clean up the qsub script to make it more flexibile with defining certain
            paths directly in the user interface, ie username, working directories
